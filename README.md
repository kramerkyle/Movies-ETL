# Movies-ETL
## Overview
This repository contains code, data, and images documenting the creation of an Extract-Transform-Load pipeline. The project relies on data from Kaggle and Wikipedia as well as Python and SQL. 

There are four Jupyter Notebooks that can be viewed; ETL_create_database is the most comprehensive of the others document either my learnings from Module 8 of the MSU Data Analytics Bootcamp or the other required deliverables that stair-stepped to the finished product.

## Additional Notes
Some files were excluded from this repository due to size constraints. They were held in a folder titled Data. The Resources folder was added to match deliverable specifications.
